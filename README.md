# 2020-Kode-tz-project
2020 collaboration project for members from Andela, Google-Africa

## Purpose of this project

The main goal of this project is to enable members of the group to collaborate and learn valuable skills such as remote collaboration, practice their programming skills and learn new frameworks.

All members of the group had a chance to add their ideas for a project to work on together, and we finally decided on one via discussion on the WhatsApp group. The details of the project are below.

In the following days we will discuss how the work will be organized and more information will be added to this repository.
The next immediate focus will be on the content and design.
